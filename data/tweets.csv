"The Netherlands national team had a particularly unproductive first half in their recent match. For the first time since June 2019, when they faced Portugal, they failed to attempt a single shot in the first 45 minutes. Even more notably, they only managed one touch in the opposition's box before halftime, a feat of ineffectiveness not seen since their match against France in August 2017.
